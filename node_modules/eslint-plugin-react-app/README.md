# eslint-plugin-react-app
This plugin exposes the ESLint configuration used by Create React App without the need of declaring all its dependencies.  
Use it if you need a simple and tested ESLint configuration without the need of installing a bunch of dependecies.  
It also works in React Native out of the box.  

## Setup
1. Install it using npm: `npm install --development eslint eslint-plugin-react-app`.
2. Extend `plugin:react-app/recommended` in your `.eslintrc`.  

Example `.eslintrc`:
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:react-app/recommended"
  ]
}
``` 

## Configuring the rules
You can configure the rules like every other plugin.
Just keep in mind that if you want to change a rule of an included plugin (for example of `eslint-plugin-react`) you must prefix the rule with `react-app/` (for preventing namespace collisions).  
For example:
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:react-app/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react-app/react/react-in-jsx-scope": ["warn"]
  }
}
```
